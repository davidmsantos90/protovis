/**
 * Constructs a new, empty panel with default properties. Panels, with the
 * exception of the root panel, are not typically constructed directly; instead,
 * they are added to an existing panel or mark via {@link pv.Mark#add}.
 *
 * @class Represents a container mark. Panels allow repeated or nested
 * structures, commonly used in small multiple displays where a small
 * visualization is tiled to facilitate comparison across one or more
 * dimensions. Other types of visualizations may benefit from repeated and
 * possibly overlapping structure as well, such as stacked area charts. Panels
 * can also offset the position of marks to provide padding from surrounding
 * content.
 *
 * <p>All Protovis displays have at least one panel; this is the root panel to
 * which marks are rendered. The box model properties (four margins, width and
 * height) are used to offset the positions of contained marks. The data
 * property determines the panel count: a panel is generated once per associated
 * datum. When nested panels are used, property functions can declare additional
 * arguments to access the data associated with enclosing panels.
 *
 * <p>Panels can be rendered inline, facilitating the creation of sparklines.
 * This allows designers to reuse browser layout features, such as text flow and
 * tables; designers can also overlay HTML elements such as rich text and
 * images.
 *
 * <p>All panels have a <tt>children</tt> array (possibly empty) containing the
 * child marks in the order they were added. Panels also have a <tt>root</tt>
 * field which points to the root (outermost) panel; the root panel's root field
 * points to itself.
 *
 * <p>See also the <a href="../../api/">Protovis guide</a>.
